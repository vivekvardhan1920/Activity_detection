# Activity_detection
DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE DATASET IS NOT ATTACHED. THE CODE SHOWS AN ERROR.
WE CAN'T UPLOAD THE DATASET HERE,BECAUSE OF THE SIZE, IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE UPLOADED ON GITHUB.

WHATEVER THE SAMPLE OUTPUTS WE HAVE CAN BE SEEN IN THE PPT.

IF WE WANT THE MODEL TO BE PERFECT WE NEED ADVANCED ALGORITHMS, WE NEED ADVANCED DATASETS AND POWERFUL PROCESSORS.

WE WANT TO BUILD A MODEL THAT CAN BE USED TO DETECT ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES AND AUTOMATICALLY SENDS AN ALERT. SO THAT THE TIME OF REACTION WILL BE IMMEDIATE.
IF WE CAN ADVANCE THIS, IT CAN BE USED EVERYWHERE.
